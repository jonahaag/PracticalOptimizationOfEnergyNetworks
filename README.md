# PracticalOptimizationOfEnergyNetworks

This repository contains the project work for the course MJ2505 Practical Optimization of Energy Networks at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.
The contents were created during the fall term 22/23.

## PRO1

The first project is concerned with load management of an electrical distribution network.
It mainly uses [pandapower](https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/v2.10.0/) for power flow anaylsis and optimization.

## PRO2

The second project is concerned with district heating of separate areas with limited thermal exchange using [BoFiT](https://www.volue.com/de/product/bofit-optimization) for optmization of the production planning.
